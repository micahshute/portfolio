    "This site was built with vanilla JS with no external libraries. It is containerized with Docker and is running on a small 3-manager-node swarm.",
    "Right now the whole screen is a canvas element. I am drawing all of the graphics using a \"composite\" design pattern to simplify development - it basically allows you to treat simple components and composites (combinations) of simple components very similarly, as long as they know how to draw themselves -- It lets you easily mix, match, and combine elements. I am using the same design pattern to design and control the more \"standard\" portion of this site as well (bottom left door).", 
    "I also use a decorator design pattern to allow elements to be displayed with a delay, to scroll text, and to make text dissapear after a set amount of time. A strategy design pattern simplifies and abstracts the animation of the sprite",
    "Anyway, control the avatar using W,S,A,D or the arrow keys to explore. You can also go to a generic normal site by visiting the bottom left door. Thanks for visiting \u{1F531}"
